# Flacbox sync

This scripts the [Flacbox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flacbox-flac-player-equalizer/id1097564256)
HTTP interface to upload songs from my MP3 library.

I've open-sourced this project as an example: it isn't meant to be end-user configurable. If you want to port it to your
preferred language, or if you know enough JavaScript to tweak the parameters, clone it and go for it!
